## Hey!<br>
**I'm junior web-developer and right now i'm learning React.js**

This is gonna be a very small one-page application for creating party of heroes like in Might & Magic VI. <br>
*(yeah... love games...)*

For now - I'm still working on this ittle thing, but [here](https://enoferge.github.io/rpg-party/)'s a working piece (need to refactor, change css making the app more adaptive).
What can you do:
* You can choose 4 heroes for your party. 
* Some heroes may have the same classes.
* Each class has its own skills, and you can choose two extra-skills from the list.
* You can choose a portrait of a hero.
* The current hero you are editing is highlighted by blue border.
* To change the hero you want to edit click on THE PORTRAIT of that hero. (Gonna make the process of moving between heroes by clicking on any point of hero's block)
* You have 50 points to add to initial stats of heroes. Choose wisely!
